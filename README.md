# demo-horizons
Directory of projects made with the intention of expanding my horizons.

Currently experiencing a sort of creative block, and realized I should learn more than Godot. This Repository will host all my small demo projects that I plan on making. Hopefully this can help reconnect with my creativity, and also provide a good dose of experience to my portfolio. The Goal is to approach any Game Engine/Framework I haven't released anything in, and make a small demo in it.

Current Roster of target Engines
